# FabricStash

## Purpose
Tracking fabric in general and custom fabric more specifically can be a tricky propsition with the given inventory methods on the market. My goal was to create an inventory tracking app that would be built around the unique information regarding fabric.

Having the ability to record what fabric you have will make planning projects much easier and allow for more flexibility.

## Information Tracking
Have you ever purchased material and not remembered where you purchased it? Have you ever lost track of the amount of yardage you got and started a project only to have to change the design because you got 2 yards instead of the 3 yard you though you did? Did you purchase some French Terry and not remember if it was cotton lycra or poly rayon, or modal? FabricStash wants to help you avoid those types of issues and more!
